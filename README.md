# Machine learning applied to IJP deposition of REBCO films
Data and jupyter notebooks used in the scientific article: A. Queralto, A. Pacheco, N. Jim√©nez, S. Ricart, X. Obradors, T. Puig, *Defining Inkjet Printing Conditions of Superconducting Cuprate Films through Machine Learning*, Journal of Materials Chemistry C, DOI: https://doi.org/10.1039/D1TC05913K.

In the article, machine learning was used for the optimization of inkjet printing deposition conditions of superconducting cuprate films. We employed a random forest regressor to create two models and used the SHAP library to provide better interpretability to the results obtained.
