This repository serves as a link to the data and jupyter notebooks used in the scientific article: A. Queralto, A. Pacheco, N. Jim√©nez, S. Ricart, X. Obradors, T. Puig, *Defining Inkjet Printing Conditions of Superconducting Cuprate Films through Machine Learning*, Journal of Materials Chemistry C, 2022, 10, 6885 - 6895, DOI: https://doi.org/10.1039/D1TC05913K, which can be found at https://digital.csic.es/handle/10261/253916.

In the article, machine learning was used for the optimization of inkjet printing deposition conditions of superconducting cuprate films. We employed a random forest regressor to create two models and used the SHAP library to provide better interpretability to the results obtained.
